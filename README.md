# Seven Languages
Companion code for [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).

## Installation

To install each langauge, run:

```sh
./install.sh
```

This will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and all the packages listed in the [Brewfile](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle).

## Notes

- I read the book via Amazon Kindle. I wanted to copy/paste snippets from the [Amazon Cloud Reader](https://read.amazon.com/) to my text editor but this functionality is disabled. You can add it by using [https://github.com/ccimpoi/ACRExtensions](ACRExtensions) to create a bookmarklet.
